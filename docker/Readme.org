#+title: Instructions for docker and package builds

This directory has a =Makefile= and a =Dockerfile= that support building for multiple
Linux distributions.

#+begin_src sh
make <distro>
#+end_src

Where distro is one of:
- Alpine
- AmazonLinux
- Fedora
- Ubuntu

** Example

#+begin_src sh
$ make ubuntu
#+end_src
*** Building the .deb/.rpm/.apk
#+begin_src sh
make package-ubuntu
#+end_src
