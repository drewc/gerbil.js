#+TITLE: Gerbil Meta-Scheme in JavaScript!

I have been a web app developer for my entire career. I like Gerbil Meta-Scheme and want to use it in the browser to interact with my services.

This is the attempt.


* Getting Started

Right now the "easy" way is simply to clone the repo and run ~./bin/build.sh~ in it.

#+begin_src bash :session gx-get-started
  cd /tmp
  rm -rf ./gerbil.js
  git clone git@github.com:drewc/gerbil.js.git
  cd gerbil.js
  ./bin/build.sh
#+end_src

Right now it fails, but does a lot beforehand. Here's what you might see.

#+begin_quote
>>> compiling gerbil core
,*** ERROR IN _gx#compile-top-source -- Cannot find method #<top-special-form #2> make-parameter
>
#+end_quote

That's a REPL that will continue with that error. Type =,q= to exit if you do not want to look around.

Now try this!

#+begin_src sh
$ ./bin/gxi-boot -
> (def (this-is gerbil: (version "bootstrap")) (displayln "This is Gerbil: " version))
> (this-is)
This is Gerbil: bootstrap
> ,q
#+end_src


* Hacking and The Log

To see where we're at, or at least the published version, view the lastest =./log/*.org= file.

Here's how I create those files in emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun gerbil.js/create-new-log ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((org-static-blog-drafts-directory "~/me/MuKn/src/gerbil.js/log"))
      (org-static-blog-create-new-draft)))
#+end_src
