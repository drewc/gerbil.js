#+TITLE: Gerbil Meta-Scheme in JavaScript!

I have been a web app developer for my entire career. I like Gerbil Meta-Scheme and want to use it in the browser to interact with my services.

This is the attempt.


* Getting Started

Right now the "easy" way is simply to clone the repo and ~./bin/build.sh~ it.

* Hacking and The Log

To see where we're at, or at least the published version, view the lastest =./log/*.org= file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun gerbil.js/create-new-log ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((org-static-blog-drafts-directory "~/me/MuKn/src/gerbil.js/log"))
      (org-static-blog-create-new-draft)))
#+end_src
